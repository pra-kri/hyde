<p class="message">
  Everything on this page is a personal reminder for the following problem:<br>
  You'll be a student for 12 months again. Which means no professional obligations or expectations. 12 months where you can study and spend your time however you want, as long as you get passing grades. <br>
  <br>
  So how should you spend your time, and what problems should you actually care about?

## MSc Modules
What optional topics are *actually* interesting? You have the chance to heavily tailor the course to your interests. Don't waste time studying material that isn't exciting.

**Why? What's interesting about them?**
* Dissertation - chance to write a (hopefully) idiosyncratic, interesting paper on whatever technical topic you want. 
* Foundations of Data Analytics - ISLR, ESL, Machine Learning, Stats.
* Natural Language Processing - Hidden Markov Models, Information Retrieval, Stats.
* Algorithmic Game Theory - Decision-making, Strategy
* Agent-Based Systems - links to Complexity Science + decision-making
* Computational Biology - Computational Neuroscience, Genetics
* Data Mining - Neural networks, Probabilistic view of ML.


**Notes**
* Over 70% of your degree is coursework. Exams and memorisation is *much* less important now.
* Term 1 coursework + assessments make up **25.00%** of your degree.
* Term 2 coursework + assessments make up **13.33%** of your degree.
* Term 3 final exams make up **28.33%** of your degree.
* Term 2,3++ Final Dissertation makes up **33.33%** of your degree.


## Afterwards
* Very few careers allow you to combine: Writing, Risk-taking (*skin in the game, courage*), Risk-management & Decision-making (*wisdom, epistemic humility*) and  Independent Thought (*contrarianism, creativity*).
* Maybe this is arrogant and overly opinionated, but I think it would be sad if you ended up in a career that didn't allow for these traits. **If the decisions you make don't involve a fair amount of risk and independent thought, and require no courage or wisdom, are you really working on anything important?**
* What sort of careers *actually* allow for this sort of combination?
    - **Startups** - look at all the Silicon Valley guys who love writing and ideas. Paul Graham, Peter Thiel, Naval Ravikant...etc
    - **Hedge Funds** - look at the investors and hedge fund managers who love writing about their ideas and principles. Thorp, Taleb, Spitznagel, Buffet, Munger, Dalio, Asness, ...etc
    - **Venture Capital** - basically the intersection of startups and investing.
    - **Strategy, Intelligence, Decision-making, Risk** - a lot of interesting papers and thoughts I've come across were written by guys working in Intelligence, Strategy, or Policy with an intense focus on Risk Management. Fields where epistemic humility is important, and screwing up has serious consequences.
    - **Writing** - writing itself is an interesting profession, but maybe I don't have enough knowledge or experience to write anything interesting...
