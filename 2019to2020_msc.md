title: 2019/2020 - MSc 
---

<p class="message">
  Everything on this page is a personal reminder for the following problem:<br>
  You'll be a student for 12 months again. Which means no professional obligations or expectations. 12 months where you can study and spend your time however you want, as long as you get passing grades. <br>
  <br>
  So how should you approach your MSc? How should you split your time between all the things you could be studying? 
</p>

## MSc Strategy
* **70+%** of your degree is coursework/dissertation related. So focus much more on deep understanding, and writing interesting papers + code. Thankfully, memorisation and exam performance matters much less.
* Term 1 coursework makes up **25.00%** of your degree.
* Term 2 coursework makes up **13.33%** of your degree.
* Term 3 final exams make up **28.33%** of your degree.
* Term 2,3++ dissertation is **33.33%** of your degree.


## MSc Modules
What optional topics are *actually* interesting? You have the chance to heavily tailor the course to your interests. Don't waste time studying material that isn't exciting.

**Why? What's interesting about them?**
* **Dissertation** - chance to write a (hopefully) idiosyncratic, interesting paper on whatever technical topic you want. 
* **Foundations of Data Analytics** - ISLR, ESL, Machine Learning, Stats.
* **Natural Language Processing** - Hidden Markov Models, Information Retrieval.
* **Algorithmic Game Theory** - Decision-making, Strategy
* **Agent-Based Systems** - links to Complexity Science + decision-making
* **Computational Biology** - Computational Neuroscience, Genetics
* **Data Mining** - Neural networks, Probabilistic view of ML.
