### The Central Idea
This is the central idea that I'm curious about:<br>
**Decision-making under uncertainty. How should you act in the face of the unknown?**

| Field/Lens | Topics |
| --- | --- |
| **Uncertainty, through Maths** | Probability Theory, Information Theory, Machine Learning. |
|**Uncertainty, through Neuroscience** | Hemispheric specialisation, Dopamine & Exploration, Reinforcement learning, Evolutionary instinct as an uncertainty and threat management system.|
|**Uncertainty, through Ethics/Behaviour** | Exploration of the uncertain territory (courage, curiosity), Culture + Tradition + Risk-management + constraint of uncertainty (wisdom, what *not* to do), Enjoying some uncertainty (adventure, serendipity), Constraining uncertainty in contracts and relationships (trust, honesty, ethics, 'sins of omission')| 
|**Uncertainty-related careers** | Careers where decisions made under uncertainty have real consequences on important outcomes; Careers where calculated risk-taking (courage, skin in the game) and risk-management (wisdom) are **necessary** - not just an afterthought. *(Investing + VC, Startups, Medicine + Health (e.g. Epidemiology), Strategy, Intelligence.)* |
