### The Central Idea
This is the central idea that I'm curious about:<br>
**Decision-making under uncertainty. How should you act in the face of the unknown?**

| Field/Lens | Topics |
| --- | --- |
| **Uncertainty, through Maths** | Probability Theory, Information Theory, Machine Learning. |
|**Uncertainty, through Neuroscience** | Hemispheric specialisation, Dopamine & Exploration, Reinforcement learning.|
|**Uncertainty, through Ethics/Behaviour** | Exploration of the unknown (courage, curiosity), Culture + Tradition + Risk-management (wisdom), Uncertainy-transferral and contracts (Trust, Ethics, 'sins of omission'). |
|**Uncertainty-related careers** | Investing + VC, Startups, Medical Statistics, Epidemiology, Operations Research, Data Science. |
