title: 2019/2020 - Focus

<p class="message">
  What are you hoping to do after you graduate? <br>
  You have 1 year as a student to pick up as many important skills as you can.<br>
  So what should you focus on? And more importantly, what should you ignore?
</p>


## What kind of careers are you actually interested in?
* You want something where you can combine: 
    - Writing
    - Risk-taking (*skin in the game, courage*)
    - Risk-management & Decision-making (*wisdom, epistemic humility*) 
    - Independent Thought (*contrarianism, creativity*).
* **If the decisions you make don't involve a fair amount of risk and independent thought, and if your work requires no courage or wisdom, are you really doing anything important?** 
* Where can you find teams that agree with this philosophy?
    - **Startups** - look at all the Silicon Valley guys take risks with their time and money, to start multiple businesses. Paul Graham, Peter Thiel, Naval Ravikant...etc
    - **Hedge Funds** - look at the investors and hedge fund managers who love writing about their ideas and principles. Thorp, Taleb, Spitznagel, Buffet, Munger, Dalio, Asness, ...etc
    - **Venture Capital** - basically the intersection of startups and investing.
    - **Strategy, Intelligence, Decision-making, Risk** - a lot of interesting papers and thoughts I've read were written by guys working in Intelligence, Strategy, Policy and Medicine. Fields where epistemic humility and risk management is important, and screwing up has serious consequences.
    - **Writing** - writing itself is fun. But more interestingly, a lot of people working in the above industries tend to write and share their thoughts + insights.  
* You need to work with opportunity 'hunting' teams, who take risks and have some skin in the game. Teams where decisions and actions have a direct, measurable impact on the outcome of something important.
* You want to be invited to work with an elite group of hunters (metaphorically speaking) who understand the value of money, time and high-impact decisions in uncertain territory. Hedge funds, startups, elite R&D teams working close to the money and edge of innovation. Not a team of obedient employees who are content to trade their time for a fixed salary, hoping for a 5% raise after 'working hard' for a year. 


## The Academic Obedience Problem
* But here's the big problem: Your MSc is clearly **not** enough to get into these teams. If anything, it's a bare minimum. Maybe it's not even necessary in some places.
* Any nerd can do well in exams. We all know that memorising an extra proof or theorem could be the difference between 55% and 70%.
* **So what actually matters?** What skills are the money-making hunters (i.e. Entrepreneurs, Investors) and self-owned teams looking for?
* What would they respect in a co-founder, co-worker or new joiner? 
    1. Definitely **not** *'oooh look at me, I'm so good at exams.'* No way, nerd.
    2. And definitely **not** blind obedience and consensus-following. Startups, Hedge-Funds, R&D are, by nature, contrarian. *If they all agreed with you, the opportunity would already be taken.*
* That means you need to be rigorous in the open market with respectable skills. Which skills, though?

## The Real Skills
You need to develop the following:


**1. Write + Think**
* Write interesting, idiosyncratic essays. Explore important topics. Sometimes controversial topics.
* Develop intense clarity of thought and think independently for yourself. Try to develop interesting contrarian opinions.
* Otherwise, how will you ever become a knowledgable decision-maker? 
* Don't be one of those guys who blindly follows the crowd, and never has ideas of his own.

**2. R&D Tinkering**
* Do mini R&D projects on whatever you find interesting at the time.
* e.g. Just read something interesting, like Spitznagel's idea of the 'Volatility Tax' or the intersection of Information Theory and Gambling? Cool. Go play around with it. Write code. Write an essay. Go tinker with it: practical stochastic tinkering + R&D.
* Pick up real-world intuition and instinct for what you learn. Don't be some nerdy philosopher hiding behind nice theories.

**3. Build + Design**
* Build cool, elegant stuff with Python, LISP and maybe Haskell. 
* Go read SICP and master the material. Become a 'great hacker' and technical decision-maker.
* Don't be so reliant on others to build and architect systems for you. You need to be able to build whatever you want quickly, to a high standard.

**4. Character + Ethics + Leadership**
* Live up to the courageous, honest men you look up to. Maybe that sounds cheesy. Sure. But there's a reason why you have an instinct for admiration and respect - it's deeply ingrained in you through evolution, the same way that loyalty and respect is deeply ingrained in pack-animals like wolves, dogs and chimpanzees. It's not just a silly, idealistic feeling that you should ignore and relegate to the realm of fiction. 
* Be the good, trustworthy guy that people want to work with. Spend time socialising and building a community. *If you don't have any character, who would trust you or work with you over the long run?*
* If you were a 'business' moron with an empty cavity for a skull you might blandly refer to some of this as 'sales and stakeholder management' like a sociopathic prick. 
* TODO - Interesting side note, and important lesson that took me years to figure out: You can be (kind, ethical, honest, likeable, humble) AND (disagreeable, unruly, proud and rebellious) at the same time. They're not mutually exclusive.
    - **Kind and humble** does NOT mean 'total pushover who gets walked all over and gets taken advantage of all the time'. You can be kind, ethical and honest **without** being taken advantage of.
    - **Disagreeable, unruly and proud** does NOT mean 'abrasive, grumpy loner'. You can be all of that **and** be liked and respected.
    - In fact, wouldn't you actively want to be disagreeable and unruly? Who ever trusts a tame, domesticated man?
    - Really. Important question: who trusts tame, domesticated men?  It was the obedient who followed the Nazi regime's orders. It was the obedient who helped implement the Gulags in Soviet Russia. It's the blind and obedient who follow genocidal and tyrannical orders by totalitarian and fascist governments. The blindly obedient are almost always complicit in tyranny and corruption. I think that's true regardless of the size of the organisation - whether that's a nation, a company or a family.
    - It is the obedient who are scared of conflict. Wouldn't they find it more comforting to sneakily commit a sin, betrayal or override their own conscience than tell you that they disagree and pay the price? 
    - Obedience and conformity is **not** a virtue. 
    - If anything, it would be more virtuous to be disobedient and unruly. Only listen to what you're told to do if you agree. No? 
    - Imagistically speaking, if you are going to do something, would you rather obey like a tame, housebroken lapdog or agree and comply like an untamed wolf with loyalty?
* Maybe this should be an entirely separate essay...

**5. Art**
* Have some interesting art and fun in your life. Don't be a bland nerd who specialises in one thing.*'Specialisation is for insects'.*
* Develop the rest of your personality - the costs of being a one-dimensional nerd in life are too much. 
* Go master Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Judo. Go play the Guitar. Go read Homer, Virgil, Tolstoy, Hugo, Steinbeck... Go drink a fair amount of beer, hang out with your friends, and go on dates with cute girls. In fact, do the bare minimum work for your MSc.
* And why not create your own art? Play some music, or write. Donâ€™t always consume what other people have created. Don't be one of those 'professional consumers' who take so much pride in consuming all the time. 


**Some final comments...**
That's the only way you can successfully become a smart, contrarian, interesting 'hunter' of opportunities.<br>
You **need** to focus on the points above. Spend all your time on them. In fact, maybe, just ignore your grades. <br>
Just doing well at your MSc is a boring, probably useless, strategy. Look at how many other CompSci graduates there are with boring jobs. <br>
If there is an activity that doesn't fall under one of the 5 categories above, maybe you should ignore it. 



**And an interesting few observations on standard employment...**
* If you get paid a nice amount of money, but are still an employee, here's the problem: You're rich enough to do what you want in the evenings, but not rich enough to do what you want in the morning. Still have to turn up to work on time, even if its not interesting.

* And, I noticed something 'fractal' about the standard employee life arc.
* So the story usually goes:
    - Work hard for the majority of your life when you're young and energetic. Tolerate the boredom. 'Work hard'. Force yourself to be 'disciplined' and a 'good employee'.
    - And then when you're older and tired and worn out, *then* you can retire and do what you want.
    - But... oh... funny. You're now old, tired and worn out - so you have *no* energy to do what you want. SO you go lie down and do nothing for the rest of your days. Maybe a bit of bland consumerism. But almost never your own project, with full energy.

* This is eerily identical to the arc of 1 weekday.
	- Work hard for the majority of your day when you're awake and energetic. Tolerate the boredom. 'Work hard'. Force yourself to be 'disciplined' and a 'good employee'.
	- And then, when the evening comes around, and you're tired, then you can leave work and do what you want.
	- But... oh... funny. You're now tired and its the evening - so you have *no* energy to do what you want. SO you go lie down and do nothing for the rest of the day. Maybe a bit of bland consumerism - Say the TV, or scrolling through facebook or something...

* And maybe there's some fractal symmetry to the week too. And maybe even a season, where the 'evening', or 'weekend' is now fractally transformed into a '2 week holiday'.
